# V 0.1

## Presentation
This is a new datapack that adds bosses to Minecraft! Summon bosses in your world and fight them with your friends! You will get cool rewards if you're up to the challenge.

## Karbonoa
1st boss you can fight. You summon him by making a 3x3 platform out of coal blocks, and then dropping a (now craftable) creeper head on the center. You will be rewarded with diamonds if you can defeat him!

## Notes
This datapack is very early in development and may contain bugs, and is also VERY unfinished. Feedback is always appreciated!
